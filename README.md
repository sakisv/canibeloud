# Can I be loud?

A website that tries to answer this simple question based on your location.

Using it as an excuse and playground to learn rust, so the code you see here is probably
neither safe nor efficient.

Feel free to open a PR and suggest improvements.

## Why though?

Inspired by a neighbour of mine, seemingly unaware of the concepts of clocks and time.

## Build/Development

Just clone the repo and `cargo run` to run it.

During development, you can install `cargo-watch`[^1] and set it to
automatically recompile and run everytime there is a change with `cargo watch -x run`
